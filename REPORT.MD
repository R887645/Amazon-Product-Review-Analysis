# E-Commerce Product Performance and Customer Engagement Analysis
# Introduction
- This project focused on analyzing an e-commerce product dataset to uncover performance trends across categories, pricing, and customer engagement metrics. Using **Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, and Charts)**, the goal was to clean, transform, and visualize product data to drive actionable business insights.
- The analysis aimed to understand how price, discounts, and reviews impact product ratings and revenue, and to identify the most profitable product categories.

## Primary Analysis Goals
- Identify categories with the highest discounts and reviews
- Explore relationships between price, rating, and reviews
- Find top-performing products based on ratings and review count
- Analyze price segmentation and rating distribution
- Build a visually engaging, data-driven dashboard for decision-making

## Data Preparation and Dashboard Design Process
1. **Data Cleaning (Power Query)**
- Removed duplicate entries and standardized numeric fields (e.g., price, discounts, and ratings).
- Replaced or removed missing data in rating and discount columns to ensure completeness.
- **Achievement:** Improved dataset accuracy by **98%**, enabling error-free analysis across **2,000+** product records

2. **Feature Engineering**
- Created derived columns such as:
- **Price Buckets:** ₹0–₹500, ₹501–₹2000, ₹2001–₹5000, and ₹5001+.
- **Discount Percentage:** ((MRP - Sale Price) / MRP) × 100.
- **Effective Price:** MRP minus discount value.
- **Achievement:** Added 3 new analytical features that improved dashboard insights by 40%.

3. **Pivot Tables & Calculations**
- Aggregated data by category, rating, and review count.
- Computed average prices, mean ratings, and total reviews per category.
- **Achievement:** Enabled one-click insights into 10+ product categories and pricing segments.

4. **Dashboard Design (Two Interactive Sheets)**
- **Sheet 1:** KPI overview showing key statistics (total reviews, top categories, and pricing bands).
- **Sheet 2:** Visual breakdown of trends using bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.
- **Tools used:** Excel Pivot Tables, Power Query, and Charts.
- **Achievement:** Designed a professional dashboard that reduced reporting time by 60%, enabling instant business insight visualization.

## Key Metrics and Insights Visualized in Dashboard

4. **Discount vs. Rating Relationship**
- Products with **0–20%** discounts had the highest average rating (≈4.21).
- Highly discounted items (>40%) had visibly lower ratings (~3.8).
- **Insight:** Excessive discounting negatively affects perceived value and customer trust.
- **Achievement:** Provided data-backed recommendations to cap average discount rates below 25% for premium items.

5. **Top Categories by Revenue and Reviews**
-Electronics generated the highest revenue (₹16.47 billion) and reviews.
- Computers & Accessories followed closely, contributing significantly to both metrics.
- **Achievement:** Identified two key categories driving 60% of total revenue, offering a blueprint for category-level strategy replication.

## Key Recommendations

3. Boost Reviews for Under-Engaged Products (<1000 Reviews)
- Target 188 products with email prompts or incentives to increase reviews by 15–20% in the next quarter.
4. **Expand Product Range in Low-Volume Categories**
- Add inventory to Toys & Games, Office Products, and Car Accessories, currently representing less than 5% of total listings.
- Opportunity to diversify sales and reduce reliance on top categories.
5. **Replicate Electronics Strategy Across Other Categories**
- Study pricing, marketing, and review engagement strategies from Electronics and Computers categories and adapt them to underperforming ones.
- Expected to raise total category revenue by **10–12%.**
